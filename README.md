# Fake news detection with NLP

**IronHack AI Engineering Bootcamp – January 2026**  
[Project in GitHub](https://github.com/santogatobaron/NLPchallenge)

---

## Project Goal

Build a **Natural language processing (NLP)** model to correctly identify whether pieces of news are real or fake news.

Given a data set of +30k headlines from pieces of news labeled as real or fake news, the project's goals are to:

  - Build different NLP models to test their performance at the task
  - Use one of those models to detect fake news in an unlabeled data set
  - Predict the accuracy rate of that model at detecting fake news 


---

## Project Overview

- **NLP models built**
  - TF-IDF + logistic regression
  - TF-IDF + random forest
  - Word2vec + Xgboost
  - TF-IDF + Naive-Bayes 

- **General preprocessing**
  - Quick EDA of format and values
  - Class balance check
  - Regex filter
  - Stopword removal
   
- **Preprocessing techniques tested in the models**
  - TF-IDF vs BoW 
  - Unigrams vs unigrams + bigrams vs n-grams 
  - Stemmers and lemmatizers
  - Parameter tuning (different in each model)

- **Evaluation**
  - Training and test accuracy
  - Confusion matrix and F1 score
  - Human interpretation based on confusion matrix and design of the models
  
- **Reporting**
  - Presentation to exhibit results, methodology, and findings
